    <h1>You went outside to investigate further.</h1>

    <p class="text">
        You open your front door to see what is going on. At the center square is a large group of villagers attempting
        to defend themselves against a giant black bear that has attacked the village! You quickly grab your combat gear
        and rush over to help them warden off the attack. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Your mentor is present at the scene, and he is helping another villager who is in quite some distress. He motions
        for you to come over and help him, but the bear is still running rampant.
        <!-- How should you help out the village? -->
