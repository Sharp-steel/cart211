        "Wake up!" A loud voice is heard next to you. You open your eyes to see your mentor standing by you bedside.
        "I'm so glad you're okay. Listen, disaster has struck the village! There was a huge bloodbath last night, and a majority of the village 
        were slaughtered overnight in mysterious circumstances." In response, you jump out of bed immediately. "Let's see what we can do to help",
        says your mentor.

        <!-- How should you help out the village? -->
