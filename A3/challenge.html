    <h1>You challenged the bear.</h1>

        You stand your ground while the bear charges at you. You quickly pull out your sword and instinctively react. 
        <br>
        <br>
        As the bear approaches you, it tries to take a swipe towards your head. Anticipating this, you dodge the attack and
        thrust your sword towards the bear's chest. It lets out a hurling cry, as your sword impales through the bear's body.
        The bear then attempts to take another swing at you to thwart you off. However, just at that moment, another blade is 
        also seen impaling through the bear's back. The bear lets out one final hurling cry and flops to the floor, dead.
        <br>
        <br>
        Your mentor pulls out his gleaming sword from the slumped-over body. "Don't be so reckless next time. Let's take care of the rest of the 
        villagers and clean up this mess."
