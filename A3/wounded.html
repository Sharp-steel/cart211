        You rush over towards your mentor, who is currently treating a wounded villager with deep flesh wound.
        "I need you to help tend to this deep cut while I go prevent any more villagers getting hurt."
        He then runs off towards the people that are trying to ward off the bear attack. Meanwhile, you care for the wounded villager successfully.
        The wounded villager gives you her utmost thanks, and says that she will never forget you for saving her life and that she owes you one.

        <br>
        You then go back to help your mentor fight alongside the other villagers, however, upon going back you have 
        discovered that the bear is already dead. You ask your mentor what happened. "I killed the bear. Let's take care of the rest of the 
        villagers and clean up this mess."
