        You decide to investigate the bloodbath that your mentor was talking about. Once you arrive at the center of the village,
        there is a pool of blood surrounding a bunch of bodies that looked like they had been shredded to pieces. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Your mentor walks up beside you as you stare in horror at the bloodshed.
        "Let's take care of the rest of the villagers and clean up this mess."
