    <p class="text">
    A white flash obscures your vision. You cannot see anything. You start to lose consciousness gradually as a form of white gas surrounds you.
    The last thing you remember seeing before being knocked out was the clothing you were wearing.
    <br>
    <br>
    Eventually, you wake up, and everything around you is white. The walls, the ceiling, the floor. Everything is white. You are in a white room,
    surrounded by computers. You look down at yourself, and discover that you are wearing clothes that are completely different than to what you 
    were wearing before. The only thing in front of you is a single computer with some seemingly obscure code. You sit pondering at your desk,
    trying to figure out how to work out what this code does and how to manipulate it.
