    <h1>You went down the river path.</h1>

    <p class="text">
        As you followed the river banking, you spotted some frantic splashing in the water.
        A run of salmon were swimming upstream, and you decided to take action.
        Using the fish hunting technique that your mentor taught you a while back, you took 
        your sword and went up towards the edge of the riverbank. The run was headed in your direction, and as the run passed through,
        you struck your sword down through the water. Luckily, you managed to pierce one square in the stomach. 
        You used sword to slice off the scaly skin, much like your mentor used to do, and returned back to the village.
