    <p class="ending-caption">Really? You went into the forest with nothing but your bear hands? What did you expect dumbass?</p>
    <p class="text">
    When you arrived in the forest, it was only a matter of time before your fate was sealed. 
    A large black bear emerged from the trees and spotted you on the forest path. Within an instant,
    she lunged towards you, and you were defenseless to say the least. She ripped off your clothes and flesh
    within a matter of minutes, and there certainly was no way of saving you.
    <br>
    <br>
    Next time, don't go hunting without a weapon. Going in bear handed will only attract the big momma to her next meal!
