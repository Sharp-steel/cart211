    <h1>You went down the forest path.</h1>

    <p class="text">
        As you went down the forest path, you spotted some rustling in the nearby bushes.
        A large black bear emerged just beside you, and alongside her was her little cub.
        As an act of defense, you started backing away slowly, trembling nervously as you did so.
        However, the momma bear didn't seem to take to kindly to your arrival, and charged towards you.
        As the bear was in pursuit, you remembered the old technique your mentor taught you a while back. You took 
        your sword and flinged it towards the momma bear's chest. Luckily, you managed to strike it across it's chest, 
        causing a great deal of pain to the bear. This was your opportunity. As it roared in pain, you rushed towards your
        sword and picked it up. You then aimed your sword towards the flesh wound and pierced the bear straight through the heart,
        ultimately dealing a fatal blow. As the momma bear toppled over dead, the cub sprinted off back into the bushes.
        You used your sword to skin off the fresh meat, much like your mentor used to do, and returned back to the village.
