    <p class="text">
        You are a youthful squire, still learning through the teachings of your mentor.
        After you finish your combat training for the day, he tells you that it is time
        to rest up for the night. It is a big day tomorrow, as it is the annual Parade,
        and you must be in top condition. As you head home to eat your final meal of the day, 
        you realize that you don't have any food left to eat!

        What do you do next?
